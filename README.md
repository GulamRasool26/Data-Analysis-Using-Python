# 📊 Data Analysis with Python Tools
Welcome to my comprehensive Data Analysis project using Python! This repository covers the full data analysis pipeline — from data importing and cleaning, through exploratory analysis and visualization, to model development and evaluation. It includes practical applications on real-world datasets like car prices, laptop specifications, house sales, and medical insurance.
## 📁 Repository Structure
###     🗃️ Datasets
This repository contains the following datasets in .csv format:

1. `auto.csv, automobile.csv, module_5_auto.csv`: Automotive datasets for price prediction and regression modeling.

2. `kc_house_data_NaN.csv`: Real estate data for predicting house prices.

3. `medical_insurance_dataset.csv`: Data for predicting insurance charges.

4. `laptop_pricing_dataset_mod2.csv, Laptops.csv`: Laptop pricing and specification datasets for regression and classification.

5. `clean_df.csv`: Pre-cleaned dataset used in analysis workflows.
